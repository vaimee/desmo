# Consensus Algorithms

In that section is explained the algorithm used to obtain the best value from **S** sources and **N** requests from the same sources.

- **S** number of sources.
- **N** number of the request for the same source with a period of **T**.
- **T** minimum time between two requests at the same source.
- **s** source
- **r** request to **s**
- **v** result of a request (**r**) to **s**
- **t** time of the return of **v** from **s**

Note:
Consider **r0** as the first request to **s** and **x0** as the date-time at the beginning of the request.
Consider **r1** as the second request to **s** and **x1** as the date-time at the beginning of the request.
Then: 
**x1**-**x0**>=**T**

# Algorithm on numbers

Each row of that table represent a source (**0 to S**), each collumn represent the requests following the period **T** (**0 to N**).
The content of the cells is the couple **v** value and **t** time, where **t** is the date of the retriev data from the source **s**

1)All data in matrix form 

| r0            | r1            | rx          | rN            |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| (v0_0,t0_0)   | (v1_0,t1_0)   | (vx_0,tx_0)   |   (vN_0,tN_0) |
| (v0_1,t0_1)   | (v1_1,t1_1)   | (vx_1,tx_1)   |   (vN_1,tN_1) |
| (v0_i,t0_i)   | (v1_i,t1_i)   | (vx_i,tx_i)   |   (vN_i,tN_i) |
| (v0_S,t0_S)   | (v1_S,t1_S)   | (vx_S,tx_S)   |   (vN_S,tN_S) |

2)Construct a matrix of value with sync on data period

1. **maxS** as the maximum of t0_i, i in [0,S]
2. **minE** as the minimum of tN_i, i in [0,S]
3. **newT** as the new period in order to sync the values, **newT**=**minE** - **maxS**/**N**
5. for each **i** in [0,S] and each **x** in [0,N] is calculate a new value:
  1. **newT_x** as the time at **x** using that new sync period **new_T**, **newT_x**=**maxS**+**newT** * **x** where **x** in [0,N]
  2. take the cell of the original matrix, where the date is closer to **tx_i** >=  **newT_x** as **(v_e,t_e)**
  3. take the cell of the original matrix, where the date is closer to **tx_i** <=  **newT_x** as **(v_s,t_s)**
  4. calculate **sv_x_i**=(((**newT_x**-t_e)/(t_s-t_e))*(v_s-v_e))+v_e

the result matrix is:

| r0                | r1                | rx                    | rN            |
| -------------     | -------------     | -------------         | ------------- |
| (sv_0_0,newT_0)   | (sv_1_0,newT_1)   | (sv_x_0,newT_x)   |   (sv_3_S,newT_3) |
| (sv_0_1,newT_0)   | (sv_1_1,newT_1)   | (sv_x_1,newT_x)   |   (sv_3_S,newT_3) |
| (sv_0_i,newT_0)   | (sv_1_i,newT_1)   | (sv_x_i,newT_x)   |   (sv_3_i,newT_3) |
| (sv_0_S,newT_0)   | (sv_1_S,newT_1)   | (sv_x_S,newT_x)   |   (sv_3_S,newT_3) |

3)Autocorrelation: find out the standard deviation between all the captured value of the same source

1. discard all punished sources (a source is punished if return at least one not valid value like "null" or the request goes out of time)
2. for each source **i** take the corresponding values **sv_x_i** (it is a list of values with **x** in [0,N])
3. calculate the standard deviation of **sv_x_i** as **sds_i** for each **i** in [0,S]
4. calculate the media of **sds_i** with **i** in [0,S] as **best_fluct**

4)Select the best source looking at how much these values fluctuates as **best_i**, the source index with the closer **sds_i** to the media of all **sds_i** with **i** in [0,S].

5)Crosscorrelation: standard deviation between the captured value from the same source in different time 

1. discard all punished sources (a source is punished if return at least one not valid value like "null" or the request goes out of time)
2. for each time **x** in [0,N] take the corresponding value **sv_x_i** (it is a list of values with **i** between [0,S])
3. calculate the standard deviation of **sv_x_i** as **sdt_x** with **x** in [0,N]

6)Get the **r** with the minimum standard deviation based on time, the request time slot index with the minimum of **sdt_x**  with **x** in [0,N] as **best_x**.

7)Find the best real value (real value, because it will come from the first matrix)

1. get the best value **best_value** of the second matrix, taking the cell at collumn **best_x** and row **best_i**
2. get the closer real value **best_real_value** (from the first matrix) to the **best_value** of the second matrix, searching only in the corresponding source **i** = **best_i**  of the first matrix

EXAMPLE)

6 sources and 4 request with 2 value not valid:
```
 [
  [ 2.11, 2.2, 2.52, 2.75 ],
  [ 2.2, 2.44, 2.44, 2.8 ],
  [ 2.4, 2.4, 2.4, 2.4 ],
  [ 2.15, null, 2.82, 2.99 ],   //Source_3 received not valid value., discarded
  [ 2.14, 2.1, 2.3, 2.67 ],
  [ null, 2.66, 2.33, 2.71 ]    //Source_5 received not valid value., discarded
]
```

# Algorithm on stings (V1) DEPRECATED

Each row of that table represent a source (**0 to S**), each collumn represent the requests following the period **T** (**0 to N**).
The content of the cells is the couple **v** value and **t** time, where **t** is the date of the retriev data from the source **s**

1)All data in matrix form 

| r0            | r1            | rx          | rN            |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| (v0_0,t0_0)   | (v1_0,t1_0)   | (vx_0,tx_0)   |   (vN_0,tN_0) |
| (v0_1,t0_1)   | (v1_1,t1_1)   | (vx_1,tx_1)   |   (vN_1,tN_1) |
| (v0_i,t0_i)   | (v1_i,t1_i)   | (vx_i,tx_i)   |   (vN_i,tN_i) |
| (v0_S,t0_S)   | (v1_S,t1_S)   | (vx_S,tx_S)   |   (vN_S,tN_S) |

2)For each row and for each collumn we find the most common value with its probability: (**c**,**p**) where **c** is the common value and **p** is the number of times of the common value over the total of samples.

3)Select all best values as the common value that is the same for the column and the row. If there is more than one value and they are different from each other, will be choosing the one which has the maximum probability for the column and for the row the probability closer to the avarage of the probability of the rows.

# Algorithm on stings (V2)

Consider all the couples of value and time of gathering of the value, then over it by the time, consider all couples from all sources. 
After that, we build a structure to estimate the time series of values. The more a value remains unchanged over time (cross sources too), the more score it is worth. The score is also affected by the amount of time in while the value remains constant.
At least select as a result the value with more score.

# Algorithm on boolean

Convert the boolean to string and then use "Algorithm on stings (V2)".

# Directory reward system

The score for a Directory is a number between 0 and 3.

We refer to best-value as the final value of the Consensus Algorithms.

All the sources will start with a maximum score of 3. If a source will be punished the score will be set to 0 and can't be increased anymore.
The Directory that will provide the value selected by the Consensus Algorithms (best-value) will has a score of 3.
The Directories that will provide valid values, but not one of them is equal to the best-value will be rewarded with a score of 1, and the Directories that will provide at least one value that is equal to best-value will be rewarded with a score of 2.

In conclusion, a Directory will has:
- score 0 for punishment, returned not a valid value, or not responding.
- score 1 if the Directory is not punished, all values returned are valid.
- score 2 if the Directory returns the best-value among its values.
- score 3 if the Directory is the one that wins the Consensus Algorithms.
